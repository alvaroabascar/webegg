# Handlers define how to route requests to your application.
handlers:

# App Engine serves and caches static files contained in the listed directories
# (and subdirectories). Uncomment and set the directory as needed.

- url: /static
  static_dir: app/main_app/static/

- url: /other_app/static
  static_dir: app/other_app/static/

- url: /(robots\.txt)
  static_files: robots.txt
  upload: (robots\.txt)

- url: /favicon\.ico
  static_files: favicon.ico
  upload: favicon\.ico

# This handler tells app engine how to route requests to a WSGI application.
# The script value is in the format <path.to.module>.<wsgi_application>
# where <wsgi_application> is a WSGI application object.
- url: /.*  # This regex directs all routes to main.app
  script: app.app



# Third party libraries that are included in the App Engine SDK must be listed

# https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/libraries27 for
# a list of libraries included in the SDK.  Third party libs that are *not* part
# of the App Engine SDK don't need to be listed here, instead add them to your
# project directory, either as a git submodule or as a plain subdirectory.
